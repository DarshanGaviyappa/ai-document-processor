2. **Best Practices**: AI suggested industry-standard patterns for file organization
3. **Error Resolution**: Quick debugging of import and configuration issues
4. **Documentation**: Generated clear comments and docstrings

## Human Contribution

All core logic, architecture decisions, tool selection, and testing were performed by the team. AI served as a coding assistant, not a replacement for understanding.
